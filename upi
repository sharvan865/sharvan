Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has sent the greatest number of mail messages. The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail. The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file. After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer



name = raw_input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox-short.txt"
name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)
text = handle.read()
#words = text.split()

words = list()

for line in handle:
    if not line.startswith("From:") : continue
    line = line.split()
    words.append(line[1])


counts = dict()

for word in words:
           counts[word] = counts.get(word, 0) + 1 
maxval = None
maxkey = None
for key,val in counts.items() :
#   if maxval == None : maxval = val
  if val > maxval:
      maxval = val
      maxkey = key   

print( maxkey, maxval)
